JIOMART.csv ML Prediction
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict [insert target variable, e.g., product sales, demand forecasting, etc.] using the JIOMART.csv dataset. The dataset contains historical data from the JioMart platform, including various features like [insert key features, e.g., product categories, prices, sales volumes, store locations, customer demographics, etc.], which are used to build predictive models.

Key Components of the Project
1. Data Preprocessing
The raw data from JIOMART.csv undergoes extensive preprocessing to clean and prepare it for model training. This step includes:

Handling missing values.
Removing duplicates.
Feature engineering to extract meaningful insights from existing features (e.g., converting dates into meaningful time features).
Encoding categorical variables to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Scaling or normalizing numerical data to ensure proper model performance.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before model building, the project involves analyzing the dataset to understand the relationships between features and the target variable. Visualizations, summary statistics, and correlation matrices are used to discover patterns, trends, and any potential outliers in the data.

3. Model Selection
Multiple machine learning algorithms are tested and evaluated to identify the best-performing model. Algorithms considered include:

Linear Regression: For a basic, interpretable model that can handle continuous prediction tasks.
Decision Trees: To capture non-linear relationships in the data.
