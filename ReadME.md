The project explores various machine learning algorithms and models to provide accurate predictions and insights based on the data.

Key Components of the Project:
Data Preprocessing: The raw data from JIOMART.csv undergoes extensive preprocessing to clean and prepare it for model training. This step includes:

Handling missing values.
Removing duplicates.
Feature engineering to extract meaningful insights from existing features (e.g., converting dates into meaningful time features).
Encoding categorical variables to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Scaling or normalizing numerical data to ensure proper model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Before model building, the project involves analyzing the dataset to understand the relationships between features and the target variable. Visualizations, summary statistics, and correlation matrices are used to discover patterns, trends, and any potential outliers in the data.

Model Selection: Multiple machine learning algorithms are tested and evaluated to identify the best-performing model. Algorithms considered include:

Linear Regression: For a basic, interpretable model that can handle continuous prediction tasks.
Decision Trees: To capture non-linear relationships in the data.
